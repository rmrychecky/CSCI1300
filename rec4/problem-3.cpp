/**
 * Algorithm: print a filled and hollow square of given width side by side to the screen. The two squares are separated by a single space.
 * 1. print the rows first while the value of the row is less than the value of the width
 * 2. while the column number is less than the width print and asterisk and increment the column by 1
 * 3. reset the column after completing one square
 * 4. print a blank column before the second square
 * 5. while the column is less than the value of the width
 * 6. if you are in the first or last row print asterisks
 * 7. if you are in the first or last column print asterisks, and if you are not print blank spaces
 * 8. increment the length by 1
 * 9. move to the next row and reset the column number to 0
 * Input parameters: an integer representing width of 1 square
 * Output: print 2 squares (1 filled, 1 hollowed)
 * Returns: nothing
