/**
 * Algorithm: takes two double inputs representing hours worked and hourly pay rate and returns the calculated total pay. Hours worked > 40 are 1.5x pay rate.
 * 1. If hours worked or pay rate < 0 return "Pay rate and hours worked cannot be negative valeus."
 * 2. Else if hours worked or pay rate = 0 return 0.
 * 2. Else if hours worked is <= 40 then calculate total pay as hours * pay rate.
 * 3. Else if hours worked > 40 calculate total pay as (hours - 40)*(1.5pay rate) + (40*pay rate)
 * Input parameters: hours worked and hourly pay rate as type double.
 * Output: Total pay as type double
 * Returns: Total pay as type double
