/**
 * Algorithm: Use the 9 inputs to decide which doors are opened on the minivan. The function returns nothing.
 * 1. If the gear is P
 *  2. If the master lock is off
 *    3. If the child lock is off
 *      4. If the left dash, inside left latch, or outside left latch is 1 and the right dash, inside right latch, or outside right latch is 1 the doors stay open.
 *      5. If the right dash, right inside latch, or right outside latch is 1 and the left dash, left inside latch, and the left outside latch is 0, then the right door opens.
 *      6. If the right dash, right inside latch, and right outside latch is 0 and the left dash, left inside latch, and left outside latch is 1, the left door opens.
 *      7. If the right dash, right inside latch, and right outside latch is 0 and the left dash, left inside latch, and left outside latch is 0, both doors stays closed.
 *      8. Else (when the child lock is on)
 *      9. If the left dash or left outside latch is 1 and the right dash or right outside latch is 1, both doors are open.
 *      10. If the right dash and right outside latch is 1 and the left dash and left outside latch is 0, the right door opens.
 *      11. If the left dash or left outside latch is 1 and the right dash and right outside latch is 0, the left door opens.
 *      12. If the left outside latch and left dash is 0 and the right outside latch and right dash is 0, both doors stay closed.
 *  13. Else print out both doors stay closed.
 * Input parameters: 8 bool variables and 1 char variables.
 * Output: print out a statement that says "Left door opens", "Right door opens", "Both doors open", or "Both doors stay closed".
 * Returns: nothing
