#include <iostream>

/**
 * Algorithm: Takes an integer value that represents month and prints out the number of days in the month.
 * 1. Use a switch with the int month
 * 2. Create conditions for each individual month coupled with c out statements.
 * 3. Create a default case where the month is invalid if none of the cases are met.
 * Input parameters:an integer number which represents the month.
 * Output: prints out the number of days in the month as "Month" <month> "has x (or y) days" or "Invalid month number"
 * Returns: none
