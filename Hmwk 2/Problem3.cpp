/**
 * Algorithm: calculate U.S. population in 1 year (365 days) using the input of initial population and given rates of change.
 * 1. Find how many seconds there are in one year.  
 * 2. Divide 1 year in seconds by 8 and add the resulting value to population.
 * 3. Divide 1 year in seconds by 12 and subtract the resulting value from population.
 * 4. Divide 1 year in seconds by 27 and add the resulting value to population.
 * Input parameters:The initial population as an integer.
 * Output:An integer that gives the value of population after 1 year.
 * Returns: nothing
