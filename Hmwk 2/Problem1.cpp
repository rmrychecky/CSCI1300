/**
 * Algorithm: takes seconds (call seconds time) as input and converts it to hours, minutes, and seconds.
 * 1. Take the value of seconds passed to the function
 * 2. Calculate hours as input/3600.
 * 3. Caclulate minutes as remaining input/60.
 * 4. Caclulate seconds as remaining input from calculation 2.
 * Input parameters:seconds as an integer.
 * Output:a string that gives: xhour(s) yminute(s) zsecond(s).
 * Returns: nothing
