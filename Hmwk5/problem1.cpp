// Homework 5 - Problem 1

/*
1. write function to calculate hamming distance
	a. initialize hamming distance, genome length and same to 0
	b. for loop to trace string and add one to string everytime same characters occur
	c. set genome length to what you are comparing with, hamming distance is the length - same.
	d. return the hamming distance as a double
2. write function for similarity score
	a. set similarity score and new similarity score to 0.
	b. genome length is the length of sequence 2.
	c. if the inputs are empty the similarity score is 0
	d. else if they are equal to begin with then calculate score as (genome_length - hammingDistance(sequence1, sequence2)) / genome_length
	e. else use a for loop to trace through string
	f. create new substrings the length of sequence 
	g. if string 1 becomes less than sequence 2 then calculate the newsimilarity score and check if it is larger than old similarity score
	h. then break
	i. else if they are equal calculate new similarity as (genome_length - hammingDistance(string1, sequence2)) / genome_length
	j. check if the newsimilarity score is greater than the previous similarity score.
	k. if it is then similarity score is the newsimilarity score
	l. else similarity score remains the same
	m. return the similarity score 
3. create a function called analyzer to print out statements about the genomes and bacteria
	a. declare maxscore
	b. if any of the input strings are empty print related statement
	c. else if they dont equal each other print the length doesn't match
	d. else if the bacteria length is longer than any of the genomes print the sequence length must be smaller.
	e. else if  they are all equal length
		1. declare and set double score1, socre2, and score3, by calling simScore
		2. if the scores are equal print all three are the best match
		3. if two of the scores are equal and greater than the third print that each one is the best match.
		4. find the maxscore by comparing score1, score2, and score3
		5. check if each invidiual score is the maxscore and not equal to the others
			i. if so print out the genome is the best match
